# Student-Result-Analysis
data analysis on a dataset of student exam scores and other personal and socio-economic factors.The notebook uses various libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize the distribution of the features, the correlation between the test scores and the other variables, and the effect of different factors on the test performance. 
The notebook aims to answer some questions such as:
What is the gender distribution of the students?
How does the parent’s education affect the student’s score?
How does the parent’s marital status affect the student’s score?
Are there any outliers in the test scores?
What is the distribution of ethnic groups among the students?
How do the test scores differ by gender?
